--Theory:

//Views

//Sorting data with ORDER BY clause
 (sort the data by one or more columns
 in the ascending and/or descending order)

//Filtering Data

//SELECT DISTINCT

//LIMIT

//WHERE clause

//Comparision and logical operators

//AND, OR, NOT and IS NULL operators

//BETWEEN, IN, LIKE

//Wildcards



--Practical tasks:

//Create table customers_addresses with primary key (auto increment) and:

//Address

//City - mandatory field

//Province

//State - for US addresses

//Postal code - a positive number, mandatory field

//Country - mandatory field



--Customers SQL Scripts 

//Create a view from customers_addresses: 

//Create a view bulgarian_customers_addresses which contains only addreses in Bulgaria;


--Filtering customers_addresses data:

//get a list of countries ordered alphabetically

//get a list of cities that start with a specific letter
(for example cities that start with letter S will return Sofia, Sozopol etc)

//get 3 different random cities located in Bulgaria

//get a list of all addresses in Bulgaria outside of Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna

//get last 10 added customer addresses with a 
province and address filled, but without a state value

//get addresses that have 4-digit postal code that start with 3 and end with 7.
Order the result alpabetically by country and city


--Acceptance criteria:

As a QA Automation trainee, I want to gain knowledge of how to:

//order and filter data

//use wildecards

//limit query output

//create and query views
